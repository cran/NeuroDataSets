Title: A Comprehensive Collection of Neuroscience and Brain-Related
        Datasets
Version: 0.3.0
Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: Offers a rich and diverse collection of datasets focused on the brain, nervous system, and related disorders. 
    The package includes clinical, experimental, neuroimaging, behavioral, cognitive, and simulated data on conditions such as 
    Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, 
    Tourette's syndrome, traumatic brain injury, gliomas, migraines, headaches, sleep disorders, concussions, encephalitis, 
    subarachnoid hemorrhage, and mental health conditions. Datasets cover structural and functional brain data, cross-sectional and longitudinal 
    MRI imaging studies, neurotransmission, gene expression, cognitive performance, intelligence metrics, sleep deprivation effects, treatment outcomes, 
    brain-body relationships across species, neurological injury patterns, and acupuncture interventions. Data sources include peer-reviewed studies, 
    clinical trials, military health records, sports injury databases, and international comparative studies.
    Designed for researchers, neuroscientists, clinicians, psychologists, data scientists, and students, this package facilitates exploratory data analysis, 
    statistical modeling, and hypothesis testing in neuroscience and neuroepidemiology.
