The `NeuroDataSets` package offers a rich and diverse collection of datasets focused on the brain, the nervous system, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. It includes comprehensive data on conditions such as **Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette's syndrome, traumatic brain injury, gliomas, migraines, headaches, sleep disorders, concussions, encephalitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and mental health conditions**.

The package contains a wide variety of data types, including clinical, experimental, neuroimaging, behavioral, cognitive, and simulated datasets. These datasets encompass **structural and functional brain data, cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI imaging studies, neurotransmission metrics, gene expression profiles, cognitive performance assessments, intelligence metrics, sleep deprivation effects, treatment outcomes, brain-body relationships across species, neurological injury patterns, and acupuncture interventions**.


## Installation

You can install the `NeuroDataSets` package from CRAN with the following R function:

```R

install.packages("NeuroDataSets")

```

You can install `NeuroDataSets` package from its GitHub repository with the following R function:

```R

library(NeuroDataSets)

```

## Dataset Suffixes

Each dataset in the `NeuroDataSets` package uses a `suffix` to denote the type of R object:

- `_df`: A data frame

- `_list`: A list

- `_tbl_df`: A tibble

- `_matrix`: A matrix

## Example Datasets

Below are selected example datasets included in the `NeuroDataSets` package:

- `subcortical_patterns_tbl_df`: Patterns of Subcortical Structures.

- `WMpatterns_tbl_df`: Expected Patterns of White Matter.

- `hippocampus_lesions_df`: Memory and the Hippocampus.

## Example Code:
