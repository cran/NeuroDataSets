\description{
This dataset, WMpatterns_tbl_df, is a tibble containing expected patterns
of white matter in schizophrenia derived from large-scale meta-analyses
by the ENIGMA consortium. It includes data from multiple neurological
and psychiatric conditions for comparison.
}
\details{
The dataset name has been changed from 'white_matter_patterns_tbl_df' to
'WMpatterns_tbl_df' to follow the shorter naming convention adopted for
the NeuroDataSets package while maintaining clarity. The suffix 'tbl_df'
indicates that the dataset is a tibble. The original content has not been
modified in any way.
