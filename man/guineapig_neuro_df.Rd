\format{
A data frame with 346 observations and 1 variable:
\describe{
  \item{y}{Numeric: Peak amplitude of spontaneous synaptic currents (pA or similar units)}
}
}
\source{
Data taken from the boot package version 1.3-31. Original study:
Paulsen, O. and Heggelund, P. (1994) The quantal size at retinogeniculate synapses
determined from spontaneous and evoked EPSCs in guinea-pig thalamic slices.

\usage{

}
\description{
This dataset, guineapig_neuro_df, is a data frame containing measurements
of spontaneous current amplitudes recorded from individual brain cells in adult guinea pigs.
The study investigated whether synaptic transmission occurs in quantal units, which would
manifest as multimodal amplitude distributions with regularly spaced peaks.
}
\details{
The dataset name has been updated to 'guineapig_neuro_df' for clarity and brevity
while preserving consistency with other datasets in the NeuroDataSets package.
The suffix 'df' indicates that the dataset is a standard data frame.
