\describe{
  \item{dbh}{Integer: Dopamine \eqn{\beta}-hydroxylase activity level (nmol/(mL\eqn{\cdot}hr))}
  \item{group}{Character: Treatment/patient group classification}
}
}
\source{
Data taken from the \pkg{BSDA} package version 1.2.2

\usage{

}
\description{
This dataset, `DA_schizophrenia_tbl_df`, is a tibble containing measurements
of dopamine \eqn{\beta}-hydroxylase (DBH) activity in 25 schizophrenic patients treated
with antipsychotic medication. The data compares DBH levels between patient groups.
}
\details{
The dataset name has been changed to \code{DA_schizophrenia_tbl_df} to provide a shorter,
neuroscience-standard abbreviation where "DA" refers to dopamine. This naming convention
maintains clarity and consistency within the \pkg{NeuroDataSets} package. The suffix
\code{tbl_df} indicates that the dataset is a tibble. The original content has not been modified.
