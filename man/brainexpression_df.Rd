\description{
This dataset, brainexpression_df, is a data frame containing expression levels of the proteolipid protein 1
gene (PLP1) in 45 individuals across three groups. The dataset includes group classifications and
corresponding PLP1 expression measurements, making it useful for comparative gene expression analysis and
studying differences in myelin-related protein expression across populations.
}
\details{
The dataset name has been kept as brainexpression_df to avoid confusion with other datasets
in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
NeuroDataSets package and assists users in identifying its specific characteristics.
The suffix df indicates that the dataset is a data frame. The original content has not been modified.
